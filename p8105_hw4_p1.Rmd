##Problem 1



Library and import data set
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(ggridges)
library(ggthemes)
pups_data = read_csv("FAS_pups.csv",col_types = "ciiiii") %>%
  clean_names()
```

Clean the dataset
```{r}

pups_data = pups_data %>%
  gather(key = pd_outcome, value = days, "pd_ears":"pd_walk") %>%
  drop_na() 
```

Plot the data
```{r}
pups_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = days, y = pd_outcome)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(aes(fill = pd_outcome), scale = .85) +
  labs(title = "Post-natal Days of Developmental Landmark")
```


As it is shown in the graph, we can see that pd_landmarks first occured in ears and following by pivot, walk, and eyes. Among them, pd_walk and pd_pivot have larger ranges compared to pd_eyes and pd_ears.
